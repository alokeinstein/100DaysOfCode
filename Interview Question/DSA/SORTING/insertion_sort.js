insertionSort([2,1,9,76,4])

/* 
When currentVal is 1 and j is initially 0, the array might look like [2, 2, 9, 76, 4] after shifting.

However, when we assign arr[j + 1] = currentVal, we actually mean:

j is -1 after decrementing in the loop.

j + 1 is 0.

So, 1 is placed at arr[0]. That's why the array correctly updates to [1, 2, 9, 76, 4]. Itâ€™s a cool trick that ensures elements find their right spot!
