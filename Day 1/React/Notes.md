QUESTION . What is component Mounting?
In React, "when the component is mounted" refers to the moment when a component is added to the DOM (Document Object Model) and is rendered for the first time.

a.Mounting:
This is the initial phase where the component is created and inserted into the DOM. During this phase, the component's constructor, render, and componentDidMount (if using class components) or useEffect (if using functional components) are executed.

b.Updating:
This phase occurs when a component's state or props change, causing it to re-render and update the DOM accordingly.

c.Unmounting:
This is the phase where the component is removed from the DOM, and any cleanup operations are performed.
