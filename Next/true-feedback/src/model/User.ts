/* 
SCHEMA:
-->You define the fields that documents in the collection will have, along with their types.
-->Schemas allow you to specify validation rules for fields, ensuring data integrity.
-->You can set default values for fields. If a value is not provided, the default will be used.

MODELS:
1.Blueprint (Schema): Defines the structure and specifications of the house.
2.Construction Company (Model): Uses the blueprint to build houses.
3.House (Document): An individual house built according to the blueprint.

   --->CONSTRUCTOR:A constructor is a special type of function in object-oriented programming that is used to create and initialize an object.

-->Models are instances of schemas.
-->Model is a constructor compiled from a schema.
-->Used to create and manage documents in the database.

Document: A document is an instance of a schema, representing a single record(house) in the MongoDB collection. Documents inherit from the Document interface provided by Mongoose, which includes methods like .save() to save the document to the database.
